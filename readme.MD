Welcome to privileged with responsibility. 
Please check out my the demo of this application on loom!
https://www.loom.com/share/63272b1563624b8e96c413eb1918cd0e

This application will still run, but will just show the loading error screen because it does not have access to the back end if the backend is not loaded correctly. 

Please feel free to download the backend of this project at if you are willing to give this project a go:
https://github.com/redazures/Backend-pwr 

Please adjust the app/api/client.js base url with your rails backend url and this application should load correctly. 

I am trying to move the rails backend to beanstalk. Once that done, I will update this readme with improved instructions. Thank you for reading! 

Best Regards,

James Wu
